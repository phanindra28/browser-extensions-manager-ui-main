- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I had a great opportunity to practice my React skills with this project. I learned to dynamically render the svg images. Also, I learned how to manage state effectively, especially when dealing with toggling active and inactive states for extensions. I also improved my CSS skills, particularly in creating responsive designs that adapt well to different screen sizes.
